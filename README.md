# From-HEAR-to-GEAR
Source code of the paper ''From HEAR to GEAR: Generative Evaluation of Audio Representations''

- "utils.py" is the python file that defines all the main methods we need in our work flow
- "FROM HEAR to GEAR.ipynb" is an initial experimental notebook for our methodology, it also produces the median results, such as the embeddings, results of Isomap, and results of scores.
- "display.ipynb" takes care of plotting, it generate the same plots as those appear in our paper

We recommend you to start with "FROM HEAR to GEAR.ipynb" for a quick check of the results, and then use the .npy files generated to continue ploting with file "display.ipynb".

Additionally, if you want no computation, please go to this google drive link for all the .npy files and plots as well:
